The way the compurter gets information from the user

Python initially treats inputs as a string type

Ex.
5 --> "5"
hi --> "hi"

Fromula Creating a variable:
  variableName = input(PROMPT)

  '''

# name = "Aastha"
#print ("My name is " + str(name))

#name1 = input()
#print("My name is " + name1)



# Ask user for school
# Ask user for grade
# Ask user for favorite color
# Ask user for the year they were born
# Ask user for age
# Print them all out

#school = input("What is your school")
#school = " quimby oak"
#print("the school is" + school)


grade = input("What is your grade")
#print("the grade is " + grade)

color = input("What is your favorite color")
#print("the color is" + color)


year = input("What year were you born on")
#print("the year is" + year)


age = input("What age are you")
#print("the age is" + age)

print("the grade is " + grade)
print("the color is" + color)
print("the year is" + year)
print("the age is" + age)
